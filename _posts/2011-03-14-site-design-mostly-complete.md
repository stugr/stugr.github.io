I&#8217;ve finally mangled the design into a wordpress theme &#8211; I ultimately settled on making a child theme of the default twentyten theme, so that if it&#8217;s updated I can easily get the latest version. Added some waffle to the homepage which I know I need to rewrite, but generally feeling pretty good about getting the site online. Next step, actually adding the proper content &#8211; which means I have to start blogging!

So far, working with WordPress has been pretty good. My biggest frustration has probably been when looking at plugins (for things like SEO), as there is a lot of choice, and I wouldn&#8217;t have a clue which is the best.
