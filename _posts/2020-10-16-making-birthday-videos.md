title:  Making Birthday Videos

Covid and Melbourne lockdown have meant that most birthdays since March have either been run over Zoom or involved people pre-recording birthday messages for their friends.

I've been responsible for compiling a few together so thought I would finally document my steps. It might not be optimal but it's what has worked for me.

- Windows 10 Photos app - video compilation and basic trimming - you'll need to at least be on the Windows 10 Fall Creators update from October 2017 - [basic guide on editing here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-start-using-photos-video-editor-windows-10)
- [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/download/) - boosting audio and any other fancy video things like un-stretching aspect ratios
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) - noise reduction

You'll likely be getting videos from all over the place in different formats. I received the majority through Messenger (.mp4), so for consistency, if a video was sent to me another way I would just send it to myself on Messenger to get an mp4 and deal with the slight compression. On your computer, go to [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/) in a browser, click the video, then click download in the top right.

Will update this post later with more specifics on how to use each app
