Below is a small collection of the Windows 7 tips I find the most useful, and most likely to be adopted by staff.

### <a name="windowskey-p"></a>Cycle through display mode / output devices (_WindowsKey+P_)

<div id="attachment_148" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/windows-key-p-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-148" title="Windows Key + P" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/windows-key-p-1.jpg" alt="Windows Key + P" width="610" height="155" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/windows-key-p-1.jpg 610w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/03/windows-key-p-1-300x76.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Windows Key+P
  </p>
</div>

Laptop users rejoice &#8211; there is now a super easy way for you to cycle through output modes, whether it be to run just the laptop screen, extend to a secondary monitor, or output to a projector. You no longer need to rely on knowing each manufacturers function key combo.

I personally use this at home daily to switch between using my monitor and TV.

### <a name="middleclick"></a>Open another instance of anything on the taskbar (_MiddleClick or Shift+LeftClick_)

Already have a browser windows open and want another? Simply _MiddleClick_ (or _Shift+LeftClick_ for those without a middle mouse button) the icon in the taskbar to quickly launch another instance. This works for any app that allows multiple copies to be open (windows explorer, browsers, word etc)

<div id="attachment_154" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/middle-mouse-button-click-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-154" title="Middle click taskbar" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/middle-mouse-button-click-1.jpg" alt="Middle click taskbar" width="369" height="40" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/middle-mouse-button-click-1.jpg 369w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/03/middle-mouse-button-click-1-300x33.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

(And as a quick aside, the same technique is used to open a link in a new browser tab if you weren&#8217;t aware)

### <a name="windowskey-search"></a>Find and open applications quickly using the keyboard (_Windows Key+type search term_)

This was in Vista too, but many people still aren&#8217;t aware of it. There is very little reason anymore to click through ones start menu to find a not often used application. Instead..

<div id="attachment_164" style="width: 421px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/start-menu-search-1.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-164" title="Start Menu search" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/start-menu-search-1.gif" alt="Start Menu search" width="411" height="516" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Search from the start menu - WindowsKey+type search term
  </p>
</div>

Press the _WindowsKey_ then start typing whatever you want to find &#8211; use the _ArrowKeys_ to move up and down the results &#8211; press _Enter_ to launch. This is especially useful for finding any setting in the control panel (eg. environmental variable, uac etc)

### <a name="ctrl-shift-enter"></a>Bonus administrator tip &#8211; auto launch as elevated user (_Ctrl+Shift+Enter_)

Taking the tip above, what if you wanted to launch the app you&#8217;ve just found using the start menu search as an elevated user? A perfect example of this is launching an elevated command prompt. You could _RightClick_ the app and choose &#8220;run as administrator&#8221; but instead..

Use _Ctrl+Shift+Enter_ to launch instead of just plain _Enter_. This will cause the app to launch elevated, auto prompting you for an admin password or approval if you&#8217;ve left UAC on (which you should)

### <a name="windowskey-l"></a>Lock workstation (_WindowsKey+L_)

Hands down, the easiest way to lock your workstation is _WindowsKey+L_.

### <a name="alt-prtscr"></a>Take a screenshot of the currently selected window (_Alt-PrintScreen_)

This is another of those tips that I use all the time but many people aren&#8217;t aware of the _Alt_ modifier. Pressing the _PrintScreen_ (_Prt Scr_) key on your keyboard will copy a screenshot to your clipboard of your whole screen including multiple monitors (which can be very wide!), which you can then paste into whatever you want. Holding down _Alt_ at the same time will only screenshot the currently selected window. Super useful.
